# SafetyShark

Policing software.
Machine Learning & Beautiful Visualizations at the service of law-enforcement agencies.

# Model
Fremium: 
```Free: receive emails```
```Paying: receive emails & texts for several people & several perimeters```
## Things To Do:
* When reporting, sometimes need to refresh before one is able to place marker. Make asynchronous call after the map loads, similar to what we did with the perimeter with a startMap() function.
* Clean email code in the backend
* Make it so that people only receive emails if they sign up for it
* Front end with nice codrops code

## Fixed
* Sometimes after refreshing map disappears. Fix that



## (Optional)
* Editing perimeter-- eventually, if we have time
